## How to use
If you have absolutely no idea what offsets are and how to use them, check out the LifeSkill Discord and read it up there.

### Start the timer
Once you have figured out your offsets you can type them in in their corresponding field for each server. For more efficiency you can also write the
exact second when it occured. If you do not want to use a specific server, or the tick time is too tight you can disable this server by unticking the checkbox next to it.

Press apply. Now the timer starts counting down to the next tick.

Once there are only 25 seconds left before the next tick a red text "SWITCH" will appear in the bottom left corner notifying you that you should switch now because
BDO Server switching can take up to 20 seconds (in my tests).

### Load/Save
You can also load and save your offsets so that you do not have to type them in every time.

## Requirements

This program uses Java 8 and JavaFX.
